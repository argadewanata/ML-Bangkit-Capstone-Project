## Abstract
Despite having many hangout spots, people in Indonesia face difficulties in finding the
perfect place that matches their specific needs and preferences. This situation leads to
frustration, waste of time, and money, as people end up visiting places that do not meet their
expectations. Our project seeks to address this issue by developing a mobile application that
offers a comprehensive database of hangout spots. The app will provide detailed information
about their features, services, and reviews, enabling users to find their ideal spot within their
budget. Additionally, the app will consider common challenges faced by people when
searching for hangout spots and leverage users' preferences and characteristics, such as
age, gender, income, and location, to provide more personalized and relevant
recommendations.
