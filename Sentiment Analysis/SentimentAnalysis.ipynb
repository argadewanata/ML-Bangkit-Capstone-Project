Meskipun sebenarnya tempatnya cukup bagus.\\n\\nDesain bangunan cafe ini ala Jawa tradisional, digabungkan dengan desain kejawaan kontemporer. Mayoritas bangunan dari kayu, jadi nuansanya cozy. Tempat duduk banyak, bisa lesehan atau di kursi. Fasilitas umum lengkap dan cukup bersih. Setiap kursi disediakan colokan, meskipun cuma 2. Parkiran luas banget, tapi kalau lagi ramai tetap bakal sempit, karena memang ada saatnya cafe ini bakal ramai banget.\\n\\nUntuk harga makanannya standar, sebagai gambaran Kopasus (kopi susu) dengan gelas mini harganya 4k, Es Jeruk Manis harganya 4k, Pecel + telur harganya 8k. Silahkan dinilai sendiri murah atau mahal.\\n\\nOverall, cafe ini cukup seru dijadikan tempat nongkrong.

Sopan dan juga wholesome.\\n\\nNamun, pas udah di meja dan nunggu pesanannya datang, agak lama banget (kira kira 15-20 menit) dan ternyata pesanan yang kami pesan ga tercatat di dapur, jadi pelayannya pakai bill kami untuk melihat menu apa aja yang kami pesen. Ini kurang oke tapi karena baru buka, kami maklumi.\\n\\nSegi makanan : Tadi mesennya Mie Sapi dengan Pangsit dan Nasi Sapi. Mie sapinya oke, nasi sapinya juga oke dan enak. Nothing special but not bad too.\\n\\nSaran :\\n\\n- Tiap meja diberi botol saos (saos tomat, kecap, saos pedas, merica, kotak tisu) karena kalian menjual mie miean. Tisunya jangan yang guede banget, eman. Mending pakai tisu box yang biasanya ada di warung warung\\n\\n- Perbanyak menu minuman. Sebagai orang yang ga bisa minum manis setelah makan asin, kami ingin kedai ini punya menu es teh tawar dan air es. Air mineralnya tadi habis, tapi karena produk kalian dijual di area kos kosan, lebih baik sediakan menu minuman yang tidak begitu pricey seperti air es dan es teh tawar.\\n\\n- Tingkatkan lagi pelayanannya ya, karena tadi lama banget dan kami diposisi laper banget (jam makan siang).\\n\\nSemoga dengan review ini kalian bisa berbenah dan berkembang.
